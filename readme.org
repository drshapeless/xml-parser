#+title: readme

This is an simple xml library for me to parse vulkan register to
generate Jai Vulkan binding because I think the binding generated by
~Binding_Generator~ is not that good.

There is an example of using this library to generate a Jai binding by
parsing vk.xml.

* Functions
The functions do not have any prefix, you may make it under a
namespace when importing.
#+begin_src jai-ts
  xml :: #import "xml-parser";
#+end_src

The available functions refer to [[./module.jai][module.jai]].

* Alternative
I have noticed a [[https://github.com/smari/jai-xml][jai-xml]] library before I wrote this. My library is
much more simpler and not as feature rich as that. None of my code
is inspired by any of the above library.
